IMMEDIATE:
- implement automatic whitespace removal to allow for easier writing
- change alias referencing to not require gestalt quotes
- generally make gestalts better, such as having functional gestalts not need so many backslashes
- 



LONGTERML
- Finish and debug rust interpreter 1.0
- Add features to interpreter, such as better error messages and ensuring reasonable code (no lists in conditional primary args)
- get a feel for the language while refining interpreter, as well as language syntax & semantics
- write a compiler (probably to c then to .exe) for qrt
- rewrite compiler IN qrt, and bask in glory
- make a good IDE for qrt
